# Secure Protocols
## Secure Applications and Protocols
1. **SSH:** It's an encrypted application and it's used to log in into different servers and it exhanging a public and private key in order to authenticate.  
2. **TLS (Transport Layer Security):** It is a protocol that creates an encryption layer between the servers and the client requesting to visit the website, fixing the non-encrypted HTTP.    

## Network Models
**OSI Model**  
1. Physical Layer.
  * Ex: Types of Cables to use.
2. Data Link Layer.
  * Everything that works with a MAC adress.
3. Network Layer.
  * IP Adressees. Ex: Routers.
4. Transport Layer.
  * Assembles and disassembles packets. 
5. Session Layer.
  * Actual conexion between two systems like TCP.
6. Presentation Layer.
  * Used to convert data into a format that your applications can read.  
7. Application.  

**TCP/IP Model**  
1. Network Interface.
  * Covers all the physical cabling, MAC adresses, network cards, pretty much everything in terms of hardware.  
2. Internet.
  * This Layer is for anything it has to do with an IP adress, for example a router.  
3. Transport.
4. Application.  

## Know your Protocols
**IP adresses**  
* IPV-4 -> **EX.** 172.16.254.1
* IPV-6 -> **EX.** 2001:0DB8:85A3:0000:8A2E:0370:7334  

**Private IP adress**  
1. Any IP adress that starts with the number **10**.  
2. Any IP adress that ranges from **172.16 - 172.31**.
3. Any IP adress that starts with **192.168**.  

**Transport Protocols**  
* **TCP:**  Connexion oriented type of protocol (),nds a lot of packages and it is how the internet works. 
* **UDP:**
