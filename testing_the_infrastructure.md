# Testing your Infrastructure
## Vulnerability Scanning Tools 
Vulnerability assessment is an action we do and we use vulnerability assessment tools to actually go about that process.  

**Tracert:** It is a simple tool but it's going to give us a lot of information about the network and we can use that as a tool to be part of our assesment.  
**nmap:** Port scanner and network analyzer tool.  
**Microsoft Baseline Security Analyzer:** Microsoft tool that will help us to see if we are up to date in our system and it's going to perform a vulnerability assessment.  
**Vulnerability assesment tools for entire infrastructure:** Nessus, Nexpos, OpenVAS.
* Management determines when vulnerability scanning is done.  
* Misconfigurations often are vulnerabilities.  
* Vulnerability scanners can be configured to scan against different databases or rule sets.  

## Social Engineering Principles 
Social engineering principles are focused more on people's behavior as apposed to their physical actions.  
1. **Authority:** To impersonate or imply a position of authority.  
2. **Intimidation:** To frighten by threat.  
3. **Consensus:** To convince of a general group agreement.  
4. **Scarcity:** To describe a lack of something.  
5. **Trust:** To assure reliance on their honesty and integrity.  
6. **Urgency:** To call for immediate action.  

**Never give to anyone private information**  

## Social Engineering Attacks 
**Phishing:** Emails that are used to steal personal information.  
**Spear-fishing:** Phishing that is directed to a specific person or company.  
**Whaling:** Spear phishing that targets senior management and executives.  
**Vishing:** Uses the telephone system to get private information.  
**Hoax:** Warns someone that something bad is happening when its not.  
**Watering hole attack:** An attempt to infect websites that a group of end users would normally go to gain access to their information or network.  

## Attacking Websites


## Exploiting a Target 
**Penetration Testing Steps**  
1. Get Authorization.
  * Define targets.
  * Attack model.
2. Discover Vulnerabilities.
  * Reconaissance.
  * Try to get information.
3. Exploit vulnerabilities.
  * Grab user names and passwords.
  * Take data from a database.
  * Corrupt webpage. 
  
**Attack Model**  
**White box:** Attackers have extensive knowledge about the target.  
**black box:** Attackers know nothing about the target, more like strangers (external hacking).  
**gray box:** Attackers know some information but not a lot.  

**Types of discoveries**
* Passive discovery (whois lookup), Semi-passive discovery(Looking a Website) , Active discovery (Attacking the server).  

**Exploiting the target**  
* We are going to use Kali Linux and Metasploit Framework.
