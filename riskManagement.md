# Risk and Management
---
## The CIA triad of Security 
1. **Confidentiality:** Is the goal of keeping data secret from anyone who has the need or the right to access that data.
2. **Integrity:** Ensures that the data and systems, everything stays in an unaltered state (_non modified_) when stored, transimeted and recieved.
3. **Availability:** We have to ensure that systems and data are available to authorized users when needed.

Following these, we also need to keep in mind a couple of other factors:
**Auditing & Accountability:** We want to keep track of things that are happening on systems like: logs, data access, modified data...
**Non-Repudiation:** Ensures that a user can't deny about having made certain modifications or communications.

## Threat Actors
These are the kind of people or organizations that are going to be performing atacks to systems. It is good to identify these threads as:

1. **internal:** Threads coming from people inside of the organization.
2. **external:** Threads coming from the outside of an organization.
3. **level of sophistication:** The amount of evil a person or organization can do measured by their funding, resources and skills.
4. **intent:** What is their intention, goal or motivation to perform these attacks.

### Types of Threat Actors
**Script-kiddies:** Those are the kind of individuals that usually we are going to get rid of with an up to date system.
**Hacktivists:** All of the attacks they perform are supporting a cause. They try to do bad things in order to prevent certain organizations to continue with their intentions.
**Organized crime:** The main motivation for these people is making money.
**Nation states:** Atacks in order to get premium data and information(gather intelligence). Their big goal is an APT(advanced persistent thread), which means hacking a system and staying there to get and monitor the information and intel.
**Insider threats:** Any person (employee, contractor, subcontractor) who can access an asset.

**OSINT:** Means open-source intelligence and provides a wide information to intrigue a threat actor. Examples might be any kind of social media platform and obviously the internet.

## What is Risk?
The potential to harm organizations, people, IT equipment...

**Assets:** Provide benefits to an organization, and are all of the parts of an infrastructured that we might be worried about getting harmed. 
**Vulnerabilities:** Weakness to an asset that it is open for a possible exploit.
**Thread:** Exploit of a vulnerability. The person who performs the attack is called a _thread Agent_.
**Likelihood:** The chance of something happening at any time and it is usually measured as a percentage. We can measure it regarding the quality _Qualitative likelihood_ or quantity _Quantitive likelihood_.
**Impact:** Total harm caused by the thread. We also can look at it qualitative or quantitative.

It is very important to deal first with the risks that have a higher percentatge of likelihood and impact to an infrastructure.

We can found a Risk Assesment guide on a document called [SP 800-30](https://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/Legacy/SP/nistspecialpublication800-30r1.pdf) by NIST.
