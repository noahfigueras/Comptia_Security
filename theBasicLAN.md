# The Basic LAN

## LAN Review
LAN = Local Area Network.  

### Switches
Switches filter and forward data based on MAC addresses (Layer 2). And we are going to review some of it's most important concepts.  
1. **VLAN:** provides layer 2 separation of networks and we can have multiple VLAN in a switch and specify which ports we want to use for that specific Network. With VLAN we can create separate networks from a single switch.  

2. **STP (Spanning Tree Protocol):** We enable STP or RSTP in a switch in order to prevent loop floods.  

### Routers
Routers filter and forward information based on IP adresses (Layer 3) and they are going to act as the gateway or interface between different network IDs.
